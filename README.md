# RL_basic
This project is a collection of the basic algorithms of reinforcement learning, based on `pytorch 1.2.0` and `python 3.7`

## Basic algorithm
1. DQN:deep Q learning
2. PG: policy gradient
3. AC: actor-critic (actor:policy, critic:value), AC,A2C,A3C
4. DDPG:Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
5. SAC:soft actor-critic
6. PPO:Proximal Policy Optimization
## Modules of each algorithm
1. layer: The structure of each algorithm network
2. models: Define the training method for each algorithm
3. model_save: Save the trained model of each algorithm
4. runs: Training process recorded by tensorboard
