# RL_basic
This project is a collection of the basic algorithms of reinforcement learning, based on `pytorch 1.2.0` and `python 3.7`

## Basic algorithm
1. DQN
2. PG
3. AC
4. DDPG
5. SAC
6. PPO
## Modules of each algorithm
1. layer: The structure of each algorithm network
2. models: Define the training method for each algorithm
3. model_save: Save the trained model of each algorithm
4. runs: Training process recorded by tensorboard
